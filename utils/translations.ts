    about_content: "I build working AI products. Fast. Without months of discussions.\n\nI'm not a classic developer with 10 years of coding behind me. I'm an entrepreneur who learned to build technical solutions because I got tired of waiting and paying for things that could be done faster.\n\nMy approach is simple: instead of 3 months writing specs — we test the idea in 2 weeks. Works? We scale. Doesn't? You've lost minimum, but got the answer.\n\n---\n\n**What I've built:**\n\n→ **Content platform with full automation**\nNews aggregation from 6+ sources, AI moderation, image generation, auto-publishing to LinkedIn and Instagram, analytics. Runs daily without my intervention. This is this website.\n\n→ **EdTech SaaS for language learning**\nNLP text analysis via spaCy, personalized learning paths, B2B architecture for corporate clients. A complex project that showed me the limits and possibilities of AI in education.\n\n→ **Workflow automation systems**\nFrom simple Telegram bots to complex n8n workflows — solutions that turn hours of routine into minutes of checking results.\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nMost companies fear automation. Not because they don't want it — but because \"by the time you explain what's needed, it's easier to do it manually.\"\n\nI get it. That's why my process is different:\n• One call instead of weeks of correspondence\n• Working prototype instead of presentations\n• Real data instead of promises\n\n---\n\n**Tech stack:**\nReact, TypeScript, Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Supabase, Azure OpenAI, Claude, n8n, Telegram API.\n\n20+ years of entrepreneurial experience. Master's in pedagogy. Fluent: Ukrainian, English, Norwegian.\n\n📍 Based in Norway. Working with clients remotely.\n\n---\n\nNot sure if your process is worth automating? Maybe it's simpler than it seems. Let's talk.",

Et komplekst prosjekt som viste meg grensene og mulighetene til AI i utdanning.\n\n→ **Automatiseringssystemer for arbeidsflyt**\nFra enkle Telegram-boter til komplekse n8n-arbeidsflyter — løsninger som gjør timer med rutine om til minutter med resultatsjekk.\n\n---\n\n**Hvorfor dette fungerer:**\n\nDe fleste bedrifter frykter automatisering. Ikke fordi de ikke vil — men fordi «innen du forklarer hva som trengs, er det enklere å gjøre det manuelt.»\n\nJeg forstår det. Derfor er min prosess annerledes:\n• Én samtale i stedet for uker med korrespondanse\n• Fungerende prototype i stedet for presentasjoner\n• Ekte data i stedet for løfter\n\n---\n\n**Teknisk stack:**\nReact, TypeScript, Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Supabase, Azure OpenAI, Claude, n8n, Telegram API.\n\n20+ års gründererfaring.

Я — підприємець, який навчився будувати технічні рішення, тому що втомився чекати і платити за те, що можна зробити швидше.\n\nМій підхід простий: замість 3 місяців написання ТЗ — перевіряємо ідею за 2 тижні. Працює? Масштабуємо. Ні? Ви втратили мінімум, але отримали відповідь.\n\n---\n\n**Що я будував:**\n\n→ **Content-платформа з повною автоматизацією**\nЗбір новин з 6+ джерел, AI-модерація, генерація зображень, автопублікація в LinkedIn та Instagram, аналітика.

Складний проект, який показав мені межі та можливості AI в освіті.\n\n→ **Системи автоматизації робочих процесів**\nВід простих Telegram-ботів до комплексних workflow з n8n — рішення, що перетворюють години рутини на хвилини перевірки результатів.\n\n---\n\n**Чому це працює:**\n\nБільшість компаній бояться автоматизації. Не тому що не хочуть — а тому що «поки поясниш що треба, простіше зробити руками».\n\nЯ це розумію. Тому мій процес інший:\n• Один дзвінок замість тижнів листування\n• Працюючий прототип замість презентацій\n• Реальні дані замість обіцянок\n\n---\n\n**Технічний стек:**\nReact, TypeScript, Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Supabase, Azure OpenAI, Claude, n8n, Telegram API.\n\n20+ років підприємницького досвіду. Магістр педагогіки. Вільно: українська, англійська, норвезька.\n\n📍 Базуюсь в Норвегії. Працюю з клієнтами віддалено.\n\n---\n\nНе знаєте, чи варто автоматизувати ваш процес?
